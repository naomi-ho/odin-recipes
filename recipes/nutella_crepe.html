        <h2>Description</h2>
        Sometimes you just want a crepe with lots of Nutella. This makes 5-7 crepes, depending on the size of the pan.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <strong>Crepes</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp (20g) unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing the pan</li>
            <li>1 cup (250 mL) whole milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (120 g) flour</li>
            <li>Nutella for filling</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Utensils</strong>
        <uL>
            <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Fine mesh sieve</li>
            <li>Hand mixer (optional)</li>
            <li>Whisk</li>
            <li>Non-stick pan</li>
            <li>Paper towels</li>
            <li>Spatula</li>
        </uL>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the butter in a small bowl and microwave for about 15 seconds, or until it is just barely melted. Remove and let it cool while you combine the milk and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Whisk them together thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add the flour next, but do so by dusting it into the bowl through a fine mesh sifter. This will help break up clumps of flour. Whisk the flour into the milk/eggs. Finally, add the melted butter and mix that in as well. If you still end up with any clumps in the finished batter, a hand mixer will quickly take care of them.</li>
            <li>Place a small pat of butter into a non-stick pan over medium heat. Spread the butter over the whole surface of the pan with a paper towel as it melts.</li>
            <li>When the pan is hot, add a ladle of batter in and swirl it around to coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Use the ladle to either gently spread the batter or add a little more if there are any “bald” spots that didn’t get covered.</li>
            <li>When the bottom of the crepe is beginning to lightly brown in spots, use a spatula to flip it and cook the other side in the same way.</li>
            <li>The first crepe usually doesn’t come out right, so don’t worry if you need to toss it and move on to the second. After the first crepe, you don’t need to add more butter into the pan for a while. Maybe after the 4th or 5th crepe you’ll want to grease it again.</li>
            <li>When you have a good crepe, pull it out of the pan and spread Nutella over half of it. Fold the crepe in half, then spread more Nutella on half of the new semi-circle. Fold this in half again and dust with powdered sugar (optional). Eat it right away, while it’s hot.</li>
        </ol>
