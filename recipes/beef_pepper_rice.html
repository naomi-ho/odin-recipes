        <h2>Description</h2>
        This recipe is inspired by the beef stir fried rice dish from Pepper Lunch. This serves 3 people.
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 oz (283.5 g) thinly sliced beef</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 green onion stalk, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 cups cooked short grain rice</li>
            <li>1.5 cups corn (canned or frozen)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Honey Soy Sauce</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2.5 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>2 grated garlic gloves</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp grated ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper (plus additional to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients for the honey sauce sauce, mix and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat your pan under medium heat and thinly slice onion and green onions while your pan is heating up. Reserve some of the green parts of your green onion to garnish at the end.</li>
            <li>Add oil to your hot pan and saute onions until they turn translucent and carmelized.</li>
            <li>Use a wooden spoon to pool the onion slices to the center of your pan. Use a bowl to mold your cooked rice then lay the rice down on top of the bed of onions.</li>
            <li>Lay the beef slices along the outsides and allow to cook for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top with corn, green onions, and butter. Drizzle the honey soy sauce over the rice and beef then mix everything together until well combined and the beef has browned.</li>
            <li>Gently spread and flatten the beef and rice mixture so the rice gets slightly crispy. Then sprinkle cheese over everything.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and top with a lid so the cheese can melt for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with reserved green onion slices and serve.</li>
        </ol>
